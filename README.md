### Project: Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Analysis System

Overview

This project aims to build a real-time traffic monitoring and analysis system using computer vision, machine learning, and cloud technologies. The system will capture traffic data using cameras, process the data to detect and classify vehicles, and provide analytics and visualizations for traffic management.


System Architecture
Components:

Cameras: Capture real-time traffic footage.

Edge Device: Raspberry Pi or Nvidia Jetson Nano for initial processing.

Server: A cloud-based server (AWS, Azure, or GCP) for further processing and storage.

Web Application: Frontend for displaying real-time analytics and visualizations.
